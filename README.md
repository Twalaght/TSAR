# TSAR - A scripted rice setup for Arch
*tsar - noun: an emperor of Russia before 1917*

## Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/Twalaght/TSAR
cd TSAR
./TSAR.sh
```

## The what and the why:
I'm a lazy person, and I don't like having to do a system setup more than once. TSAR is a barebones script to deploy my dotfiles and install some essential programs on a fresh Arch based system. There's really not much more to it.
