# TSAR - Twa's Scripted Auto Rice
*tsar - noun: an emperor of Russia before 1917*

## Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/Twalaght/TSAR
cd TSAR
bash TSAR.sh
```

## What TSAR does:
I'm a lazy person. I don't like having to do things more than once. TSAR is my portable kit to configure a fresh Arch install to my liking. These scripts probably are not to useful to anybody who is not me, but it also holds my dotfiles, if you are interested in them.
